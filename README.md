### Project Title
Exploration of US Bikeshare data

### Description
This project uses Python scripting to explore US Bikeshare data across three cities - Chicago, New York City and Washington. It involves interactive input from the user and shows a range of useful statistics, some of which are - popular starting/finishing times, trip duration, most common start and end stations and user type. It also allows the user to view a sample of the data.

### Files used
Files used in the creation of the project are three data files -
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv  
The project also contains one python scripting file -
* bikeshare.py

### Software requirements
Software needed to explore the data or the python script are -
* Python (with numpy and pandas add ons)
* A text editor like Visual Studio Code or Atom
* A shell terminal application like GitBash

### Credits
